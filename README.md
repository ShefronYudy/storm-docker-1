storm-docker
============

This repository is forked from https://github.com/wurstmeister/storm-docker
and contains some edits that are specific to the
[storm-alerts](https://github.com/viki-org/storm-alerts) repository.

At Viki, we use this repository for setting up the
[storm-alerts](https://github.com/viki-org/storm-alerts) repository.
In fact, our Storm `alerts` topology runs within the docker images built from
this repository.

## Original introductory text (from [storm-docker](https://github.com/wurstmeister/storm-docker))

Dockerfiles for building a storm cluster.
Inspired by [https://github.com/ptgoetz/storm-vagrant](https://github.com/ptgoetz/storm-vagrant)

The images are available directly from

## Setup for running storm-alerts within storm-docker

This section details the steps needed to setup the `storm-docker` repository
so it is ready for running the Storm topology in the
[storm-alerts](https://github.com/viki-org/storm-alerts) repository.

You should perform the following on the production server that you are going
to run [storm-alerts](https://github.com/viki-org/storm-alerts) on.

### On Storm's Logging Configuration

Storm 0.9.x makes use of [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) as the abstract logger
and [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) as the concrete logger.

**NOTE:** Whether storm-docker uses the `storm/cluster.xml` file as the actual
logging configuration file is just a guess, but one I'm relatively confident of
being correct.

When you build the Docker images (steps are detailed below), the
`storm/cluster.xml` configuration file will be used as the `cluster.xml` file
for Storm. This happens to be the configuration file for logback, so you may
want to review it and change the logging configuration settings.

Additional documentation on logback can be found here:

- [http://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html)
- [http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html](http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html)

### Install Docker

For Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (LTS), ensure that your Linux Kernel is a relatively
recent version (check the docs here:
http://docs.docker.io/installation/ubuntulinux/ for more information).

Use the following command from the top of the script at http://get.docker.io
to install Docker

		wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/ | sh

Check the information for your Docker installation:

		docker info

You should see something like this:

		Containers: 1

		Images: 4
		Storage Driver: aufs
		 Root Dir: /var/lib/docker/aufs
			Dirs: 6
			Execution Driver: native-0.1
			Kernel Version: 3.11.0-19-generic
			WARNING: No swap limit support

If the value for `Storage Driver` is `aufs` we need to change it to btrfs.
Edit the `/etc/default/docker` file and edit the `DOCKER_OPTS` line like so:

		DOCKER_OPTS="-s btrfs"

This tells docker to use btrfs as the filesystem. Restart Docker:

		service docker restart

Do a `docker info`, you should see something along the following:

		Containers: 0
		Images: 0
		Storage Driver: btrfs
		Execution Driver: native-0.1
		Kernel Version: 3.11.0-19-generic
		WARNING: No swap limit support

Notice that the storage driver is now `btrfs`. This is what we want.

### Cloning this repository

Clone this repository, preferrable to `$HOME/workspace/storm-docker`.
At `$HOME/workspace`:

    git clone git@github.com:viki-org/storm-docker.git

### Building the Docker images

Run the `rebuild.sh` script:

    ./rebuild.sh

If this is the first time the Docker images are being built, this script will
take some time to complete.

### Run the Docker images

using the `start-storm.sh` script:

    ./start-storm.sh

And now the server is ready for running the
[storm-alerts](https://github.com/viki-org/storm-alerts) repository. Follow the
instructions [here](https://github.com/viki-org/storm-alerts) for setting up the
storm-alerts repository if you intend to deploy the storm-alerts topology to the
server you just did the above setup on.

## To stop the Docker images

Take a look inside the `destroy-storm.sh` script if you only need to stop
specific Docker images. This can probably be done using `docker kill`.

If you wish to stop everything (or if you're lazy), run the `destroy-storm.sh`
script:

    ./destroy-storm.sh

Do not be alarmed by the `docker rm` commands in the script. Rebuilding the
Docker images after a `docker rm` is faster than running the `rebuild.sh`
script for the first time as results are being cached.
