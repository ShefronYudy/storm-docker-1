# Hosts running storm-supervisor.
#
# Each item in this array represents a single storm-supervisor node running in
# a Docker container.
#
# Each item should have the following keys:
#
# - `ip`: An IP address for the node/machine running storm-supervisor.
#         NOTE: This IP address must be accessible by ALL storm components.
#
# - `aliases`: A list of aliases that can be used to identify the
#              storm-supervisor node.
#              The 0th alias will be used as the hostname for the Docker
#              container running the storm-supervisor.
