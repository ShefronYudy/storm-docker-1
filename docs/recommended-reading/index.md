Recommended Reading
===================

If you're new to Storm and/or Docker, here are some good articles that will
greatly enhance your knowledge.

## Storm

The official Storm documentation. Recently shifted to the Apache Storm website
from Storm's Github wiki:

- [http://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Home.html](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Home.html)

The **Manual** page contains a lot of useful information on Storm.


[Michael Noll](http://www.michael-noll.com/) has written some good tutorials on
Storm. Here are the ones we've read and found very useful:

- [http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-multi-node-storm-cluster/](http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-multi-node-storm-cluster/)

## Docker

[https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)

Seriously. The official docs are just that good.
