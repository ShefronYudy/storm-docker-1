This project would not have been possible without the following
organizations/people.

## Viki Inc.

- Engineering Page: [http://engineering.viki.com](http://engineering.viki.com)

storm-docker was originally an internal project started to meet the demands of
our Storm cluster. Subsequently it was deemed sufficiently generic and useful
enough to the community (this _should_ be true, especially after the kind of
time effort we spent on getting Storm to work within Docker) and allowed to be
open source.

## wurstmeister/storm-docker

storm-docker is based on
[wurstmeister/storm-docker](https://github.com/wurstmeister/storm-docker).
We've learnt a lot about Docker studying the Dockerfiles in that repository.

Big thanks to wurstmeister for making his work open source!

## Leap Day theme

The github pages theme is a slightly modified
[Leap Day](https://github.com/mattgraham/Leap-Day) by
[Matt Graham](http://madebygraham.com/).

While the sunny feeling of the Leap Day theme does not quite fit with Storm
(it should be dark, cloudy and there should be thunder), it is a very beautiful
theme.
